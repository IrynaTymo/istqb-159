As a Customer, when I open archive folder in Tracker, I want to see a listbox with my archived parcels, 
where each item of the list will contain main information about parcel like ID number, name of the partner 
and date of adding. Then when I click on an item of the list it will open new folder where I will see the 
whole information of my parcel.

 Given: The main information about each archives parcel
 When: The user click on any item of the list
 Then: The user will get the whole information about each parcel
